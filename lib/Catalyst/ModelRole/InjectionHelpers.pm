=head1 NAME

Catalyst::ModelRole::InjectionHelpers - Common role for adaptors

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package MyApp::MySpecialAdaptor

    use Moose;
    with 'Catalyst::ModelRole::InjectionHelpers';

    sub ACCEPT_CONTEXT { ... }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Common functionality and interface inforcement for injection helper adaptors.
You should see L<Catalyst::Plugin::InjectionHelpers> for more.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

This role defines the following attributes

=head2 application

Your L<Catalyst> application

=head2 from

A class name or coderef that is being adapted to run under L<Catalyst>

=head2 method

The name of the method in your 'from' class that is used to create a new
instance  OR a coderef that is used to return an instance.  Defaults to 'new'.

=head2 roles

A list of L<Moose::Role>s to be composed into your class

=head2 transform_args

A coderef that you can use to transform configuration arguments into something
more suitable for your class.  For example, the configuration args is typically
a hash, but your object class may require some positional arguments.

    MyApp->inject_components(
      'Model::Foo' => {
        from_class = 'Foo',
        transform_args => sub {
          my ($adaptor_instance, $coderef, $app, %args) = @_;
          my $path = delete $args{path},
          return ($path, %args);
        },
      },
    );

Should return the args as they as used by the initialization method of the
'from_class'.

=head2 get_config

=head2 injection_parameters

=head2 injected_component_name

TBD

=head1 METHODS

This role exposes the following public methods

=head2 merge_args

Responsible for merging global configuration and anything passed in at call
time

=head2 transform_args_if_needed

Perform any programmatic argument transformation

=head2 build_new_instance

Responsible for returning a new instance of the component.
